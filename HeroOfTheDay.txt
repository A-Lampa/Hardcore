Mama they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames


Do you feel your names?
Do you hear your babies crying?


Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me
